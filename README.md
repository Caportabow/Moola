## About the Project

**Moola** is a desktop application designed to monitor currency exchange rates with detailed statistics:

- Current rate
- MTD (Month-to-Date) — performance since the start of the month
- YTD (Year-to-Date) — performance since the start of the year
- Historical data

The app combines a Rust backend parser with a modern Vue 3 frontend using shadcn/ui components for a clean, responsive, and attractive user interface. Tauri powers the native cross-platform capabilities with minimal resource usage.

## Why I Built This
